### Hello

I'm Alex, an iOS Engineer that loves SwiftUI & ☕️

Here's a quick bit about me whilst I work on a better readme.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Coffee Book](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/coffee-book/id1512681263) 1.3.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build server side apps with vapor, and how to use k8s.
- 👯 I’m always happy to collaborate on projects that help people - self care, fitness etc!
- 💬 Ask me about anything iOS, I'd love to help.
- 📫 me@alexanderlogan.co.uk
